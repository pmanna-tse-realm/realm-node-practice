## Realm for Node.js: best practices

This sample code illustrates some of the best practices suggested for the MongoDB Realm Node.js SDK with a Partition-based setup.

These include (but are not limited to):

- Use of `newRealmFileBehavior`  and `existingRealmFileBehavior` recommended policies
- Progress listener
- Handling of a client reset error, with code to recover objects added and/or updated client-side when Sync wasn't available
- An agnostic codebase: app ID, (optional) credentials and partition value are passed in as arguments, so in principle any Realm DB can be examined


## Usage

The general usage is
```
noderealmpractice [<parameters>]
```

### Parameters

#### --appId='\<appId>'

Sets the App ID (usually in the form _\<name>-abcde_) to connect to - **required**.

#### --partition='\<query or value>'

Partition **_value_** filter for the local DB, accepts an expression (for example `{"$oid": "61b19aa00787xxxxx00000xx"}`) that returns a **single** partition - **required**.

#### --user='\<username>'

Username to connect to the Realm app with (Email/Password authentication).

#### --password='\<password>'

Password related to the _user_ specified above.

#### --apiKey='\<API Key>'

Authenticates with API Key provider.

#### --jwt='\<JWT>'

Authenticates with Custom JWT Provider.

#### --custom='\<username>'

Authenticates with a Custom Function, passing this parameter as username.

#### --clean

Deletes a pre-existing local DB, logs out the current user, if any, and ensures a fresh copy is downloaded.

#### --logLevel='\<Log level>'

Sets the Log Level (i.e. 'info', 'debug', 'trace', â€¦). The SDK log is collected in a separate file within the project folder.

## Install

As with every Node.js script, after checkout fetch the external modules:

```
cd <script folder>
npm install
```

To install the utility so that it can be invoked from the command line in a terminal:

```sh
cd <script folder>
# makes index.js executable
chmod ugo+x index.js
npm install -g
```
